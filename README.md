Friday Project 9

To make file work, create a file called .env in the same folder and add your OPENAI API key. Format is as follows:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-INSERT CODE HERE

Copy and paste your code after the = sign. There should be no space or " around the sk-proj code. Make sure to save the files so it updates with which file to pull from. Output includes a check that checks to make sure it's loaded the API key correctly to pass onto the GUI, so it will output your full API code to you in the terminal. Make sure this is your correct API code.
